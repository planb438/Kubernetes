🔍 Scenario 09: Audit Logging & Incident Forensics
📘 Real-World Context
Your cluster must record who did what and when — especially when investigating incidents or suspicious access. Kubernetes provides audit logging, which logs all requests sent to the API server and can be filtered with fine-grained rules.

In this lab, you’ll:

Enable audit logging on the control plane

Define a policy that logs secret access

Trigger a test (access a Secret)

Inspect the log to confirm traceability

🎯 Objectives
Create an audit policy that logs secrets access

Patch the API server to use this policy

Trigger a secret read

Check the audit log for the event

Understand audit event structure (user, action, timestamp)

# 🔍 Scenario 10 – Kubernetes API Audit Logging

## 🎯 Goal
Enable audit logging to track access to Secrets and detect suspicious API activity.

## ✅ What You Do
- Define a policy that logs all `secrets` access
- Patch the API server to use the policy
- Trigger an access event
- Parse `/var/log/kubernetes/audit.log`

## 🔎 Test Steps
```bash
./patch-apiserver.sh
./trigger-access.sh
./inspect-audit-log.sh
💡 CKS Tips
Audit logs are essential for forensics

Exam may ask you to detect reads, deletions, or exec into pods

You can filter logs by verb, user, namespace, or resource
