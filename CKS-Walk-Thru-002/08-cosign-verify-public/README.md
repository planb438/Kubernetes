✅ Revised Scenario 9: Cosign Verification (without Signing Your Own)
Instead of signing your own image (which requires Docker Hub auth + push), we’ll use a public image that’s already signed by its publisher. That way, you can focus on Kyverno + verifyImages, without fighting Podman + registry permissions.

📘 Real-World Context
Many official images (like distroless, ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign, etc.) are already signed with Cosign and verifiable with public keys.

🎯 Objectives
Install Cosign (CLI)

Install Kyverno (if not installed)

Use Cosign to verify an existing signed image

Create a verifyImages policy in Kyverno using a public key

Try deploying:

✅ Signed image → passes

❌ Unsigned image → fails

🧩 Image to Use: ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign
This is a small, signed image by the creators of Cosign.

# 🔐 Scenario 9 – Cosign + Kyverno with Publicly Signed Image

## ✅ Goal
Validate signed container images using Kyverno and public Cosign keys.

## 💡 Key Concepts
- Use images already signed by trusted orgs (e.g. Sigstore)
- Avoids complex login + push
- Kyverno’s `verifyImages` can use remote public keys

## 🧪 Test
```bash
cosign verify --key https://Fulcio.sigstore.dev/ghcr.pub ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign
kubectl apply -f signed-pod.yaml   # ✅
kubectl apply -f unsigned-pod.yaml # ❌
