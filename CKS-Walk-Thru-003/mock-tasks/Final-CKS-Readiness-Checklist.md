🧭 Final Tips Before the Exam
⏱️ Practice under time constraints (20–25 mins/task)

🧠 Memorize core kubectl flags and shortcuts (e.g., -o jsonpath, --dry-run=client)

🔍 Know where logs/configs live: /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log, /etc/kubernetes/, etc.

📄 You can use man, --help, and kubectl explain during the exam
