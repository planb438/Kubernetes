🧠 CKS Exam Strategy: "Prioritize, Apply, Validate"
✅ 1. Start with What You Know Cold (Easy Wins First)
Begin with short, 1- or 2-step tasks (e.g., apply a NetworkPolicy, block NET_RAW, restrict hostNetwork)

These are fast, often worth good points, and reduce pressure

✅ 2. Mark Hard or Time-Consuming Tasks for Return
If a task involves:

Falco config

Admission webhook TLS setup

Large Kyverno verifyImages logic

✏️ Use the built-in notepad to mark and skip temporarily

Return later only if you have time left

✅ 3. Always Get Partial Credit
Even for hard ones:

Write the YAML scaffolding (apiVersion, kind, metadata)

Add basic structure and comment out uncertain parts

Run kubectl apply --dry-run=client -o yaml to test

Apply even partial work — never leave blanks

✅ 4. Use the Terminal Efficiently
You'll get a kubeconfig preloaded

Set:

bash
Copy
Edit
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kube/config
export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
Create manifests quickly:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl run test --image=busybox -n dev --command -- sleep 1000
kubectl explain pod.spec.containers.securityContext
✅ 5. Use Bookmarks — But Only for Syntax
You get a static documentation mirror (like kubernetes.io/docs)

Bookmark:

Kyverno policies

PodSecurity standards

Audit policy reference

AppArmor annotations

Search for examples, not concepts — you don’t have time to read pages

✅ 6. Validate Everything
After applying resources, validate with:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get all -n your-ns
kubectl describe pod your-pod
kubectl auth can-i get secrets --as=system:serviceaccount:ns:sa
✅ 7. Use Time Milestones
2 hours = 120 minutes

Assume ~7–9 tasks total

Checkpoint yourself every 20–25 minutes

⏱️ Task 3 by minute 40

⏱️ Task 5 by minute 70

Last 15–20 mins for returns, cleanup, sanity checks

💡 Final Advice
Don’t panic if you don’t finish everything — passing is ~67%

Aim for clean YAML, working logic, and clear scope

Trust your practice — you’ve done real labs
