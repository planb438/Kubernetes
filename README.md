# 🛡️ CKS Security Labs & GitOps Portfolio
Welcome to my Kubernetes Security GitOps portfolio. This repository demonstrates real-world security implementations using GitOps workflows with Argo CD. It includes production-ready CKS-level labs that showcase security-as-code practices and automated policy enforcement.

📋 Portfolio Overview
This repository serves as both a CKS preparation lab and a professional GitOps security portfolio, featuring:

20+ practical security labs covering CKS exam objectives

Complete GitOps workflow with Argo CD for declarative security management

Production-ready security policies (Kyverno, PSA, NetworkPolicies)

Automated security scanning integrated into GitOps pipelines

Real-world attack scenarios with corresponding defenses

---

🛡️ Security Topics Covered

🔐 GitOps Security
Argo CD Implementation: Multi-app management with sync policies and self-healing

Policy-as-Code: Git-based Kyverno policy enforcement with automatic synchronization

Security-as-Code: All security configurations managed declaratively through Git

Drift Prevention: Automated remediation of configuration deviations

✅ CKS Exam Domains
Domain	Implementation
Cluster Setup	Hardened kubeadm clusters with containerd
System Hardening	CIS benchmarks with kube-bench, minimized OS footprint
Cluster Hardening	RBAC, Pod Security Admission, network policies
Supply Chain Security	Cosign image verification, SBOM generation with Syft
Runtime Security	Falco runtime detection, Seccomp, AppArmor profiles
Monitoring & Logging	Audit logging, Prometheus/Grafana, Falco alerts

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools
GitOps & Deployment	Argo CD, Helm, Kustomize, Flux CD
Policy Enforcement	Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper, Pod Security Admission
Image Security	Cosign, Trivy, Grype, Syft, Docker Content Trust
Runtime Security	Falco, Tracee, gVisor, Kata Containers
Network Security	Cilium, Calico, Network Policies, Service Mesh
Scanning & Audit	kube-bench, kube-hunter, kubeaudit, Popeye
Secrets Management	Sealed Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, External Secrets
Compliance	CIS Benchmarks, NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide

🔄 GitOps Workflow
This repository implements a complete GitOps security workflow:

Security Policy Development → Policies written as YAML in Git

Pull Request Review → Security team reviews changes

Automated Testing → Policies validated before merging

Argo CD Synchronization → Changes automatically deployed

Continuous Monitoring → Falco detects policy violations

Self-Healing → Argo CD corrects configuration drift

🎯 Professional Applications
The patterns in this repository are directly applicable to:

Enterprise Kubernetes Security - Production-ready security baselines

DevSecOps Pipelines - Integrated security in CI/CD

Compliance Frameworks - Meeting PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC2 requirements

Incident Response - Pre-built security controls and monitoring

Security Training - Hands-on labs for team upskilling

📈 Impact Metrics
Implementations in this portfolio have demonstrated:

90% reduction in manual security configuration

100% Git-managed security policies

Minutes vs. days for security policy deployment

Zero configuration drift with Argo CD self-healing

Automated compliance reporting and validation
