## Private Registries & ImagePullSecrets
Once you're all clean and confirmed, we’ll move on to:

🔐 Private Registries & ImagePullSecrets — pulling from private Docker registries securely.

Awesome! Let’s walk through Private Registries & ImagePullSecrets — a key skill for the CKS, especially when dealing with secure image pulls and image provenance.

🔐 What Are ImagePullSecrets?
ImagePullSecrets are Kubernetes secrets used to authenticate against private container registries (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Harbor).

🔧 Step-by-Step: Using a Private Docker Registry
We’ll simulate using a private image by setting up a fake private pull (even if it doesn't exist, you’ll see how the auth flow works).

✅ Step 1: Create a Secret for Registry Auth
Format is: Docker config JSON
bash
CopyEdit


kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ \
  --docker-username=your_dockerhub_username \
  --docker-password=your_dockerhub_password \
  --docker-email=your_email@example.com \
  -n dev-002


Verify:
bash
CopyEdit


kubectl get secret regcred -n dev


If you want to test with real images, make sure they are marked private on Docker Hub.

🧪 Step 2: Create a Pod That Uses the Secret
yaml
CopyEdit


# private-image-test.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: private-test
  namespace: dev-002
spec:
  containers:
  - name: private-container
    image: your_dockerhub_username/private-image:latest
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: regcred




kubectl apply -f private-image-test.yaml



📋 Step 3: Confirm Behavior
• If auth is correct: pod should pull image (if it exists).

• If image doesn't exist or secret is wrong: pod will be stuck in ImagePullBackOff.


You can verify events with:
bash
CopyEdit


kubectl describe pod private-test -n dev-002



🚀 Bonus: Set ImagePullSecrets at Namespace Level
To avoid repeating secrets for each pod:
yaml
CopyEdit


kubectl patch serviceaccount default \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "regcred"}]}' \
  -n dev-002





Now, all pods in dev namespace automatically use regcred.
Let me know if youâ€™d like to test this with your real Docker Hub creds, or just want to move forward and simulate behavior using fake image references.
Next up after this: image signing and provenance (optional for CKS, but great for bonus points). Ready?
