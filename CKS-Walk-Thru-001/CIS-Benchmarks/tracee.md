Tracee is a runtime security and forensics tool that utilizes eBPF to monitor and analyze events within Linux-based cloud deployments, especially within Kubernetes environments. It helps detect suspicious activity by capturing and analyzing system calls and other events. Tracee can be deployed as a daemonset within Kubernetes or run as a standalone agent on any Linux host
